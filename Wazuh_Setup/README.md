# üõ°Ô∏è Wazuh Monitoring Project

## Description  
This project demonstrates how I set up a Wazuh server on a VirtualBox Ubuntu virtual machine to monitor logs from my main Windows system.  

The goal of this setup is to understand how a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system collects, analyzes, and visualizes security events in real time.

## What I Did  
- Installed **Ubuntu Server** on VirtualBox.  
- Configured **Wazuh Manager** on the Ubuntu VM.  
- Installed the **Wazuh Agent** on my Windows machine.  
- Connected both systems to monitor security logs and alerts through the Wazuh dashboard.  
- Captured screenshots to illustrate the process and results.

## Files in This Folder  
- `Wazuh_Tutorial.md` ‚Üí step-by-step guide I wrote to replicate this setup.  
- `Screenshots/` ‚Üí images showing my configuration and Wazuh dashboard results.

## Purpose  
This project helped me gain hands-on experience with SIEM tools, log management, and basic security monitoring ‚Äî essential concepts in cybersecurity.
